To create a node server that incorporates CSS styling and images.

URL Requests:
The server must be capable of handling the following URL requests:

localhost:7890/theaters: Shows a simple HTML page having some pictures of theatre locations and label (ex. specific mall). Again, make sure these pictures are stored on your server.
localhost:7890/movies/new: Shows a simple form where the user can add new movie information. For the /movies/new HTML page, there is no need to store this information in the database, nor is there a need to validate the entries. The form should be simply present on the page.

Getting Started:

Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install.
Start the server by running node app.js.
Open your browser and go to localhost:7890.
Test the URL requests mentioned above.
